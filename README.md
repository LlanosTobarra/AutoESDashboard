Dashboard for AutoES Tool

About
-------------

AutoES' objective is the analysis of a service-oriented system to manage the self-evaluation of practical activities and the continuous assessment of the students' progress. Service-oriented applications are considered as the latest generation of Internet-based platforms. Using our system, students will be able to perform a self-evaluation of their activities and, additionally, the system will be able to solve all the errors made in the activity or configure it completely, with a penalty in the mark for the activity.

This project is focused on the development of a better student and teacher dashboard that allow to track the performance of learning.
